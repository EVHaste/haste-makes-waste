These are working titles. No ETA; they're done when I feel good about them.

### The Fireplace

![](/images/featured/the-fireplace.jpg)

This piece will be a dramatic retelling of a few sessions of Monster of the Week I played with my friends. I'm really impressed and humbled by their improv abilities, and I hope I can do them justice.

We've completed two of the three sessions, and I have a partially completed draft. I dug up some reference images. This one is unique in that I may post it early and just update it later; I have no idea when we'll be able to play the last session with the pandemic being what it is.

### Welcome* to Night City

![](/images/featured/cyberpunk-press.png)

This one's on the use of genderqueer and transgender bodies to sell copies of CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077.

I've finished playing the game, and completed my research on its marketing. I'd still like to do a bit more on the specific personalities at CDPR which came up while I was doing my homework.

I've got an idea of my thesis, finished writing the opening and necessary context. This may be the biggest piece I've worked on yet, though, so I'm taking my time with it.

### Renegade Ghost Chapter 2

I have a rough idea of what this chapter must contain, but haven't completed an editable draft yet.

### You Can't Go Home Again

![](/images/featured/spyro.png)

An analysis of references to real world cultures and politics in the original Spyro the Dragon trilogy.

I've finished playing two of three of them, and taken a lot of notes. Definitely have a clear thesis already.

I'd like to do supporting research so that I have something more productive to say than "game bad".

### Omori

![](/images/featured/omori-press.jpg)

I love this game and am positive I'll have something to say about it, but I haven't finished it yet so I have no idea what that will be.

### TL;DR - A Manga Guide to Cryptography

![](/images/featured/goofy-code.jpg)

I've partially completed this book, and have started drafting. This one is lower on my priority list.

### TL;DR - White Fragility

![](/images/featured/blm.jpg)

I'd like to complete a series of three articles to introduce social justice topics and critical race theory to audiences who would otherwise be resistant. The first one would cover White Fragility (on the basis of being most palatable to a conservative audience), followed by Stamped from the Beginning, and How to Be an Anti-Racist.

I need to complete the last couple of chapters and review my notes before I can draft this.
