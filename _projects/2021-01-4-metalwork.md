I caught the blacksmithing bug at the Carolina Renaissance Festival in 2019. [The Dragon Forge folks](https://www.dragonforgeexperience.com/) were giving on lessons on how to create simple knives from materials like railway spikes and horseshoes.

A couple of their smiths were apparently on *Forged in Fire*. They were great teachers and even bent the lesson plan for me a little. Thanks, fam!

There's something weirdly cathartic about blacksmithing. Apparently you can make a safe, cost-effective forge out of materials in your own home. **If you're from my apartment complex and you're reading this**, I would *definitely* never attempt that. [^1]
