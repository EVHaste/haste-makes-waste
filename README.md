# Haste Makes Waste
A lightweight blog which leverages Jekyll and Netlify to generate a static site from a Github repo. Neatly sidesteps hosting costs.

Find it in production [here](https://evhaste.com/).

# Tech Stack

* [Jekyll v4.2.0+](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generation.
* [Ruby v2.5.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (though the bulk of the project is CSS)
* [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) for package management.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as a serverless backend.

# Setup

1. Install prerequisites.
2. Clone repo to your machine.
3. Fire the new directory up in the IDE of your choice. (I'm partial to [Atom](https://atom.io/).)
4. Build the project on a local server. (In [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/), accomplish this using `bundle exec jekyll serve`).
5. View local changes in-browser at `http://localhost:4000/`.

# Contact

Everything is [@EVHaste](https://github.com/EVHaste)'s fault.

The irony of listing contact details in the readme of a project which itself contains a contact page is not lost on me.
