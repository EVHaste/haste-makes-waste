o hei fam!

My name is **Elizabeth Haste**, but I can tell we're going to be great friends, so you can just call me **Val**! My pronouns are *she/her*. I will also answer to *Your Majesty*.

I'm a queer leader, a woman in tech, a feminist, a witch, an anarchist, and a badass.

My irl alignment is chaotic-good, at BEST. When I grow up, I want to be a necromancer.

Also, I once ate so much spaghetti and threw up so hard, that I had an out-of-body experience.

<sub><sub>That is a true story.</sub></sub>
