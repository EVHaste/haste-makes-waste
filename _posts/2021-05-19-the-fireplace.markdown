excerpt: "There’s an old, abandoned fireplace out in the middle of woods near the old Edinbar factory.
Rumor has it that if you light it with a friend, you’ll be visited by a strange man. He can make your wish come true, but only one of you will leave. The other is grist for the factory.<br><br>
Whatever you do, never light it alone. If you’re lucky, nothing will happen. Not everyone is lucky."

Our story takes place in Sienna, Colorado. It's a small, quiet town comfortably nestled at the edge of the Northern Front Range. Red-orange patches dot the September landscape, choked under the encroaching sea of pine.

There are more houses here than there are people to fill them. A haunting optimism lingers over what qualifies as "downtown" these days. Once hopeful storefronts and shopping centers are darkened, waiting for a promised industrial boom that all but evaporated with the closing of the steel mill.

#### Population: 287

#### Highway exit: seldom used

#### Weather: unpredictable

The year is 1990. Welcome home.

For as long as anyone has known Sean Bennett, Crenshaw High’s chess club star, he has never, *ever* missed first period.

But now, he’s missed **three**. His seat is cold in the front row.

Officer Wright, the school’s resource officer, has been pulling Sean's friends into the office since yesterday. *When did you last seen him? How were things at home? Do you know if he was into drugs?* His classmates have been swapping questions they’ve been asked, speculating wildly.

Today the posters went up. **MISSING**.

Mrs. Bennett had to be gently escorted off of campus again during lunch. She knocked the officer's hat off in the struggle, but he doesn't hold it against her. He'd do the same if his kid disappeared. Well, for any longer than usual.

Four students, presently in detention, will find themselves wrapped up in this mystery before the end of the day. And they'll drag a few more into it with them, for good measure. At the moment, though, only two of them even care that he's gone.

#### That will change soon enough.

We'll start with the usual suspects.

It is, after all, no surprise that **Heather Wright** (*the Crooked*) is here. Detention is practically her home. Whatever she called Ms. Bree today will never reach her permanent record; it's already stuffed full of other petty crimes. Bless Officer Wright's heart, he does try to reel his daughter in, but you can never truly tame a rebel.


The staff have long since learned not to bother assigning Heather lines, else she fill the chalkboards with obscenities, so that honor belongs to **McKenzie "Mack" Harris** (*the Searcher*). Her hand is beginning to cramp.

#### *I will not sneak into the teacher's lounge to misuse school equipment.*

#### *I will not sneak into the teacher's lounge to misuse school equipment.*

#### *I will not sneak...*

Mack had tried to argue that printing fliers for her amateur cryptid-tracking radio show, *The Sienna Sentinel*, was an educational use. *The people have a right to know what's out there*!  Her teacher didn't buy it, unfortunately, and it just made the sentence longer. On the bright side, the ink was already wasted, so they let her keep the fliers.

**Tiffany Thomas** (*the Wronged*), cheerleader for the Crenshaw Cougars, plucks one of those fliers from Mack's bag. You'd be forgiven for assuming she intends to bully her for it, but actually they know each other pretty well. They've shared a grief counseling group ever since her sister, Tera, vanished without a trace a year ago. They know, personally, the kinds of creatures that lurk in the shadows of Sienna, even if nobody else will believe them. Their loss binds them together.

### To be continued...
