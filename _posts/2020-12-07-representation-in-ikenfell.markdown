The central thesis of Paradise Killer is that we form our own truth, based on our interpretation of the facts. Facts are not, as commonly believed, inherently neutral. Inevitably, whoever interprets facts is applying to it their own perspective, which is inseparable from "cold, hard logic".


"The facts don't care about feelings" - Lady Love Dies, ver batim.

Summary: Lady Love Dies has been exiled for 8,000 years after making some bad decisions. The council has been murdered, and you're the only one who can crack this locked-room mystery.

The art style is unique. High emphasis on human bodies, island is surrounded by nude sculptures. Really wants to convey a sort of sultry vibe.

Vaporwave soundtrack is full of good bops.

Cast is diverse. Canonically bisexual protagonist. Complete with unethical amounts of sleeping with suspects.

Open world phoenix wright, with one big case made up of smaller mysteries.

Platforming is awful due to the way momentum is calculated, but exploration is still fun somehow.

Real sense of this island falling apart as the game progresses, especially post trial. It's almost sad to leave.

Completely unstructured investigation. You interview who you want and follow up on what's interesting to you. Or don't. Begin the trial when you please, whether you're honestly ready or not.

Interesting choice at the end; characters you inevitably like are guilty of things. You can selectively present certain facts to cover for them. But do you?

Ultimately whatever you present is the law. As the interpreter of truth, you mete out judgement and executions largely unopposed.

No "true" ending, only "your" ending.

Interrogates the inherent class imbalance to society. Henry is the insect under the foot of a capatalistic and deeply dogmatic society. Ultimately, there's no way to save him.

You are clearly evil but seem to sleep with that just fine.

At first I joked "haha am I going to have to find you all guilty" but by the end I was just like "god dammit every single one of you is actually guilty and I like some of you, could you not"
