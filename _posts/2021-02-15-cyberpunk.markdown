### If you're reading this, you're probably either poking around in my Github repo, or it's been like, a thousand years and I died without posting it.

#### Either way, whether you're a fellow programmer or an internet archeologist from the future, let me just say: hey fam! I love you.

##### See you soon!



ðŸŽµ Goooooood morning Night City!

From the moment CD Projekt Red began using transgender bodies to sell its newest project, I have been utterly transfixed. My fingers were crossed that I'd find a respectful place in its world. And if you squint, you can almost see where one would have gone.

### This article is a comprehensive dive into representation of gender-expansive identities in Cyberpunk 2077.

From Claire to Chromanticore, we're going to use a queer lens to chronicle every inch of this game's history, marketing, gameplay, and release. [^1]

[^1]: I'm not interested in the bugs, missing features, or performance controversies. There are plenty of reviews and articles about those things already. I'm publishing this almost four months after release because I wanted to really take my time with it, and do my research.

Because they're areas of interest for me and disproportionately affect the trans community, we'll also talk about its handling of mental health, suicide, and sex work. It goes without saying that **I will be thoroughly spoiling this game from this point forward**.

Hopefully when we're done, we'll be able to answer the question:

> #### When an artist leans on an oppressed identity to market its game, what responsibilities do they have in representing them? And, critically-

> ### Has CDPR succeeded?

Hope you take your soy ramen spicy, choomba.

*You get to be in a game!* he says, *my game! People will looooove your body. Now you won't be invisible anymore. And hey, you're welcome.*

Ugh. Give me a break.

At one time in my life, I was starving for representation of any kind. What choice did I have? If I wanted to see a person like me on TV, my options were cross-dressing serial killer, or the tragically murdered prostitute in the opening of every episode of CSI.

That's it, that's all you got; predator or fetish object. It rubs the lotion on the skin, or it gets erased from society again. For the longest time, this was the only way I could conceptualize my future. How could I ever transition, knowing what was going to happen to me?

But today, transgender people are more visible than they've ever been, and people are starting to see us in roles other than killer/corpse. We're senators(link). We're superheroes(chalice). We can be nurturers(Pose), friends(she-ra), and role models(dreadnought). Sometimes we get sucked into the inter-dimensional gateways between displays in IKEA(Finna). Just like everyone else.

It's great that you've finally noticed my community and all, CDPR, but don't fool yourself. Being portrayed as a fetish object isn't doing me any favors. I might have thanked you for your time ten years ago, but not today.

Because I'm not desperate anymore.
