It's been a long time since I've attempted to write poetry, so I thought
I'd have a go at it.

As a bonus, I recently rediscovered what must be the last poem that I had written. I was still in high school at the time. I've included it here at the end, for your enjoyment.

**Dedicated to a Short Lived Leaf**
{: style="text-align: center"}

Watch fierce winds knock free a leaf from branch,

and as it pirouettes toward the earth

like it was nothing,

tell me which is greater.

**Untitled**
{: style="text-align: center"}

The ice grows thicker, sharper,

encircles her

even when she doesn't mean it.

<br>


Sometimes the walls of her cell block all sound.

The only voice is her own,

rarely kind.

She worries there is no end to it,

a permanent frost.

<br>

But inside there is a light

to nourish the hearts

of the patient and the worthy.

<br>

This is not her prison.

It is a measure of control in a maelstrom.

If it speaks to you, then chip away.

**A Terrible Poem About a Dog (2009)**
{: style="text-align: center"}

I pull the leash,

drag you along

so I can poop

on Neighbor's lawn.

I sniff your butt,

I hump your leg.

Give me the treat!

Don't make me beg.

God, I was so *classy* back then. What happened to me? /s

This was a class assignment, and I was absolutely *determined* not to display a shred of vulnerability. I think that this is the purest example of the emotional growth that I have made in adulthood.

(One of my classmates wrote a satirical deconstruction of it, taking it as seriously as possible. I still love that. It was either Alice or Jaime, I can't tell from the handwriting. Lord, I have amazing friends. I should frame it.)

I'm not proud of the original, but it does makes me smile. Even thinking about it today, it feels like someone else's memory. Like my imaginary brother wrote it, and I just remember it somehow? I feel the same way when I look at a photo of myself pre-transition.

Anyway, I need to shake off some of the poetry rust, but I think I would do this again.
