excerpt: "Just one lil poem on its lonesome, this time. I feel like this one wants to be longer. I hear you lil poem, I'll keep noodling on you."

Late night poetry practice; I feel like this one is missing several somethings. I think it wants to be longer, and to have more variety in rhythm and rhyme scheme. Maybe just a stanza in between, or maybe after with a second verse. I'll keep thinking about it.

Did you know I used to write poetry all the time in grade school? I rarely shared it, got embarassed about them and just sort of quit altogether. I'm trying to give myself permission to be rusty.

## An Unnamed Poem
#### (I do this a lot, don't I...)

Empire,

wasteland,

shareholder high wire,

sun-bleached bone and

homes kindle for wildfire.


Anchor,

heritage,

kindergarten massacre,

self driving car with

eight billion passengers.
