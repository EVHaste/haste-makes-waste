excerpt: "There’s an old, abandoned fireplace out in the middle of woods near the old Edinbar factory.
Rumor has it that if you light it with a friend, you’ll be visited by a strange man. He can make your wish come true, but only one of you will leave. The other is grist for the factory.<br><br>
Whatever you do, never light it alone. If you’re lucky, nothing will happen. Not everyone is lucky."
