# Mailer-Daemon

I’ve saved up every disquieting thought

that you’ve gifted me,

every uncomfortable sensation,

and wrapped them carefully

to return to you.

From here on they’re yours to carry.

I have no need.

# Untitled

Vengeance is the serpent’s coil

a slow drip of poison on the tongue

the sudden gasp from a lover’s lips

the sweetest release

a sin surely worth the price.

# Similarly Untitled

Wretched creature, may you succumb to a famine of spirit.

Let my justice be slow, but absolute.

<br>
You may sleep

but will find it fitful.

You’ll have no rest

and find no peace.

<br>

You may drink to excess,

but no substance on this earth

will ever slake your thirst

Or fill your hollow days with meaning.

<br>

You will cry out

and no one will help you

or hear you

or care.

<br>

And you will question,

“Can I?”

flickers of hesitation that compound

into days

and weeks

and years of time

you can never recover.

<br>

In those quiet moments

when you are alone and desperate,

look again over your shoulder.

Know that I was there,

just out of view,

that I saw your weakness

and that it pleased me.
