Little known fact about me; I have *a thing* for gimmicky dating sims. I donâ€™t know where I picked the habit up, but I love them unironically.[^1] And **Boyfriend Dungeonâ€™s** premise seems scientifically engineered to hook me; date your sentient weapons, who are also people sometimes. **Alright, sold. Say no more**.[^2]

#### I went in expecting something goofy, but I have to say this game took me completely by surprise. Itâ€™s **shockingly** sincere, at times uncomfortably relatable, and **I canâ€™t recommend it enough**.

In this article, weâ€™ll discuss how Boyfriend Dungeon contrasts via gameplay both **healthy and unhealthy consent models**. Weâ€™ll also break down the anatomy of an abuser, by isolating **specific emotional manipulation techniques** that are employed by its antagonist.

#### Finally, weâ€™ll talk about the unique potential of **dating sims as learning tools**, which **empower survivors** of abuse to safely re-engage in intimate relationships.

**Spoilers for the entirety of the game ahead**; if youâ€™d like to play it (which I highly recommend), [maybe do that first](https://store.steampowered.com/app/674930/Boyfriend_Dungeon/)! It's only five or six hours long. **Content warnings** for: domestic violence, stalking, emotional abuse, and also Iâ€™m gonna say the word sex a couple times. ðŸ‘»ðŸ˜±

# Your Armory of Amore

Okay, so what even is this hot mess?

Boyfriend Dungeon is a visual novel with rouge-lite dungeon crawling elements, in which players alternate between randomly generated hack-and-slash combat sections, and flirtatious downtime with the supernatural residents of Verona Beach. Originally kickstarted by Kitfox Games in August 2018, it released last month on PC, Xbox, and the Nintendo Switch.

<!-- There's also a terrible racing minigame in there, don't play it. -->

While the protagonist is player-generated (pronouns included!), they have a set character arc; your cousin Jesse, who has recently moved in with a partner, has graciously offered to let you live in his old apartment until the lease runs out at the end of the summer. Your character struggles with anxiety, panic attacks, and a general fear of intimacy for reasons which are left undefined, which has your family worried about you. More specifically, Jesse has learned you have never been on a date before, and is determined to meddle, or at least net you some friends.

SWORDS ONLY.

One of your first dates (with a fencing instructor who is incidentally sweet, buff, AND a sword) inadvertanetly introduces you to the game's primary mystery.

#### Unique to the world of Boyfriend Dungeon is the concept of a "dunj"; ever-shifting worlds that open up beneath public spaces, and are shaped by the fears of those who enter.

As you explore the dunj, you're joined by a cast of "weapon-people"; that is, individuals who can transform into a specific weapon roughly corresponding to their personality, who have awoken in the dunj to find their memories hazy and pieces of their weapon forms missing. Together you can face your fears, solve the case of the kidnapped weapons, and grow as people.

Outside the dunj, you can then use the cash and treasures you've collected to craft gifts for your new friends or lovers, and hanging out with them in the downtime allows you to increase your bond and unlock new abilities.

### Yeah, so basically, it's the game loop of Persona.

<!-- Needs work -->
The cast is diverse, featuring multiple people of color, non-binary characters (plural!), and yes that's a cat you see there.[^3] You're free to set boundaries and define each of those relationships as strictly platonic, without missing out on content. Also unsual for a game in this genre is the ability to politely opt-out of sexual encounters, without necessarily closing off the romantic aspect of the relationship, which frankly is something more games should allow.

<!-- Needs work -->
Most of the characters that you meet are kind, patient, and respectful of your needs. One notable exception is not. And one of the things that makes Boyfriend Dungeon such a mature take on dating sims is the way that the world contrasts the communication styles of these characters, drawing attention to predatory behavior and clearly demarkating it as unacceptable.

# When Weapons are Affectionate

![](/images/boyfriend-dungeon/group.png)

The vast majority of Boyfriend Dungeon is spent highlighting examples of healthy communication and sexual agency. Your relationships with weapon-people set the tone for what is appropriate in this world, and by extension our own. So let's start there.

[Cat pets]

[Sawyer & expectations]

[Explicit consent requests, allowing romance to continue of sex is declined (usually)]

[Dagger & holding weapons]

[Sunder, who texts like my dad...]

# When Affection is Weaponized

[Break down the playbook Eric uses]

These techniques are instantly recognizable by survivors of domestic violence. Hell, by most women, Iâ€™d wager.

# Datings Sims as a Safe Space


---

Every once in a while, a game comes along that is just precisely what you need at that moment in your life. Thatâ€™s the space that Boyfriend Dungeon occupies for me in 2021. Iâ€™m in the process of rehoming to my own Verona Beach, and to be honest Iâ€™ve been really anxious about it. But playing this game has helped me feel more in-control. It re-affirms my confidence in my ability to spot toxic relationships and to prioritize my own mental health. Also the OST is beautiful and calms me right down.

This will be my airport theme on repeat in a few months.


Iâ€™d also just like to take a second to appreciate the thoughtful depiction of a world in which polyamory and gender transition are both normalized. The former is especially rare in gaming.

More than anything, this game gives me hope. That somewhere out there is a world full of people who understand consent, respect boundaries, who are interesting and interested. When I play this game, I feel like *I can do this*, and that real, healthy love is attainable within my lifetime. I feel safer, and maybe even motivated to conquer my own dunj.

I think more people should be able to experience that sense of peace. [^4]



[^1]: My digital polycule-slash-resume currently contains such nonsense as a pigeon, a computer, a sad dad, a transgender eldritch being, and three completely distinct casts of cats. Yes, I own *three* games where you can date a cat. No, I don't know why.

[^2]: There were two timelines before me: one where I do not play this game and continue being a boring person, and another that has a meet-cute with a lightsaber. Obviously Iâ€™m going to pick that second one.

[^3]: (Why does this keep happening to me?)

[^4]: To the folks at Kitfox, if this somehow makes its way to you: thanks for making this game. Itâ€™s really important to me.
