Between surgical recovery, starting a new job, building a new discipline out of thin air, and planning a (possibly international) move, these past few months have been a whirlwind. What little free time I've had available has felt especially precious. So, I haven't had the energy to devote to my usual critical analysis articles.

But as always, I've got the itch to do *something*. So, welcome to installment two of what I might as well make a regular feature here: a low-stress, lucky-ten-thousand style gush about things I've just learned about or found especially interesting in the last month or two. They could be books, articles, games, whatever (but let's be honest, they're probably leftist video essays). Anything goes as long as it engages my brain a little, and brings me joy.

As last time: this article wonâ€™t be super deep or scholarly, but I give myself permission to just be excited about stuff sometimes. Come along with me, won't you?
