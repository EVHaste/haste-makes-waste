excerpt: 'Inspired by the nakedly visible income inequality of downtown San Francisco.'

---

I wrote these while out of town to help care for my partner, during her FFS recovery.

Inspired by the nakedly visible income inequality of downtown San Francisco; I never want to forget the sickness that I felt that day.

The system we live in is truly rotten. And the most horrifying part is that we can all treat it as normal.

# Asset Protection

A pair of socks

in a spider-wrapped lockbox.

More dignity afforded to the K-9

than the man lying

in an alcove

who could use them.

Two cops flank the doors

of the Apple Store.

A sign says:

“This area under video surveillance”,

and I believe it.

# Nothing Personal

Discarded needles

lay on the sidewalk

underneath the feet

of busy shoppers.

No time to read signs

scrawled on damp cardboard

from salvaged boxes.

Check your phones instead.
