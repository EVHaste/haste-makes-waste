There's a stark difference in the purpose that CDPR's marketing and development arms envisioned for the queer community in the world of Cyberpunk 2077, which I find fascinating. Transgender bodies exist in a unique place in media right now; semi-accepted by way of transaction and exotic marketability, but against a political backdrop that would see us erased.

So whenever I see transgender characters included in marketing material, my fingers are crossed that I'll find a respectful place in that world. And if you squint, you can almost see where that would have gone in Night City.

### This article is a comprehensive dive into representation of gender-expansive identities in Cyberpunk 2077.

From Claire to Chromanticore, we're going to use a queer lens to examine the game's history, marketing, story, gameplay, and reception, in relation to their uses of transgender bodies. [^1]

Because they're areas of interest for me and disproportionately affect the trans community, we'll also talk about its handling of mental health, suicide, and sex work, mostly in the story and gameplay section. It goes without saying that **I will be thoroughly spoiling this game from this point forward**.

Hopefully when we're done, we'll be able to answer the question:

> #### When an artist leans on an oppressed identity to market its game, what responsibilities do they take on in that group's representation?

And, critically:

> ### Has CDPR succeeded?

Hope you take your soy ramen spicy, choomba.

# Summary

Cyberpunk 2077 is a first-person shooter with light RPG elements, developed and published by Polish studio CD Project Red following the success of The Witcher trilogy. After approximately nine years in development, it was released in 2020 across six platforms.

Much like The Witcher before it, however, the Cyberpunk brand was not created by CDPR. The license originally premiered as a tabletop role playing system created by Mike Pondsmith in 1988. It has received four editions, with the most recent being 2020's *Cyberpunk Red.* Pondsmith himself would be brought in on a consulting basis for Cyberpunk 2077.

It's important to make this distinction because while the two games exist canonically in the same universe, CDPR was able to take creative liberties with themes and details of the original work, and many of the notable elements of the video game that we'll be discussing here are missing or altered from the source material.

The video game's story is centered around a partially player-generated character known only as V, whose consciousness is partially merged with that of terrorist Johnny Silverhand as a result of a brain injury during a heist that goes sour. V's identity is slowly overwritten by that of Silverhand over the course of the game, compelling them to search for a cure in between bouts with their alter-ego's least favorite megacorporation, Arasaka.

Night City is both a setting and a character unto itself, serving as an expressive hub world littered with collectables and errands for V to run. The main game loop lands somewhere between Grand Theft Auto and Deus Ex, with quest providers largely requesting someone be shot or designating something to be stolen. The player is able to use a handful of cyberware tools to achieve that goal, generally by killing everyone in the room, hacking bits of technology on the network, sneaking past, or some combination of those things.

# The Marketing

Oh god, the marketing.

# The Game

Only slightly better.

* Games of this scope are made by hundreds of people from different backgrounds. Nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in the tone of the game's text and voice acting, which oscillates wildly between introspection and hate. It must be noted that you can say some remarkably fucked up things to people, completely unprompted. And not as a Renegade / Paragon kind of thing either. [Shop examples] These are almost always aimed at members of historically marginalized communities, centered on their appearances.


# Some Notes About Launch

Despite its lengthy development period, Cyberpunk 2077 is notorious for releasing in an incomplete and often downright unplayable state. The title was delayed numerous times and contains few of the open-world freedoms promised in marketing materials prior to launch. It also released against a backdrop of credible allegations against the company, detailing worker exploitation, crunch, and team burnout. [^2]

While this is arguably irrelevant to the game's physical text and subtext, it would be a mistake to ignore the context under which it was developed. We can learn quite a bit about CDPR's corporate culture from the way it treats its employees, after all, and it certainly colors requests to assume positive intent for the multiple, consecutive gaffes described in this article.

Ugh. Give me a break.

At one time in my life, I was starving for representation of any kind. What choice did I have? If I wanted to see a person like me on TV, my options were [cross-dressing serial killer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVwR4H9eNTw), or the [tragically murdered prostitute](https://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television). Either way I could be sure they would be [suffering from some unnamed mental illness](https://www.csifiles.com/content/2013/02/review-csi-crime-scene-investigation-strip-maul/).

That's it, that's all you got; predator or fetish object. [It rubs the lotion on its skin, or it gets erased from society again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCSZfmbFJyQ). For the longest time, this was the only way I could conceptualize my future. How could I ever transition, knowing what was going to happen to me?

But today, transgender people are more visible than they've ever been, and people are starting to see us in roles other than killer/corpse. We're senators(link). We're superheroes(chalice). We can be nurturers(Pose), friends(she-ra), and role models(dreadnought). Sometimes we get sucked into the inter-dimensional gateways between displays in IKEA(Finna). Just like everyone else.

It's great that you've finally noticed my community and all, CDPR, but being portrayed as a fetish object isn't doing me any favors. I might have thanked you for your time ten years ago, but I'm not desperate for representation anymore.
