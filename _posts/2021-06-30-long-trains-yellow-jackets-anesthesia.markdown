excerpt: "These are the things that kept me company, brought me joy, or taught me something while I recovered from transition surgery this summer."

It still feels kind of unreal.

After almost six years of waiting, innumerable sacrifices, and reckless leaps through the burning, acid-soaked hoop that is the American healthcare industry, I have *finally*, successfully received transition surgery.

And you know what? It was still worth every second of it. [^1]

I'd like to do a write up on the experience at some point, to help folks who come after me through the process. But damn, *recovery is wild*, so I've given myself permission to rest for a while.

This article won't be complex, or profound, or persuasive, but that's okay! They don't all have to be.

### So these are the things that kept me company, brought me joy, or taught me something during my sabbatical.

I hope they bring you joy, too!

### The Owl House

![](/images/long-trains-etc/owl-house.jpg)

I binged most of this show from my hospital bed, in the hazy couple of days after my surgery. Yet, it really stuck in my memory.

The Owl House is a Disney Channel cartoon that wound up on my radar due to its inclusion of a canonically bisexual character (something Disney has historically and vehemently opposed). And, yeah, that's in there! Like, in the actual show and everything. It's not super explicit, but it is on-screen and not in the last episode squeezed ten seconds before the end credits. I'll take it!

The premise presents itself as *character from modern world longs to adventure in a traditional fantasy setting*, but quickly subverts audience expectations and creates something wholly original.

The character and world designs are creative, and beautiful, and also *surprisingly macabre for a children's show*? Especially in the early episodes. One of the monster designs in particular had me jump in my seat, and I am *not* easy to shock.

Great animation, sincere characters, would highly recommend if you dig shows like Gravity Falls. <sub><sub>Which I do.</sub></sub>

### Infinity Train
![](/images/long-trains-etc/tulip.jpg)

I can't say enough good things about this show. I watched a bit of Infinity Train every day during my post-op care routine, and not only did it successfully capture my imagination to the point that I sort of stopped noticing I was in pain, but I even ended up looking forward to that time every day.

It's a Cartoon Network original, which was picked up by HBO in its third season. Ten minute, bite-sized episodes, a-la Steven Universe, with well developed characters (especially in the first couple of seasons) and just a *ton* of heart.

Putting together the mystery of this setting is kind of the point of the experience, so my lips are sealed on that. Overall I felt like I was watching an alternate reality version of Rick and Morty, that didn't rely on nihilism to convey its message or visual squick to get a rise out of the audience. Oh, and it has a story. Like, with continuity. And a point.

It's really wholesome overall but it also contains a lot of content that I was shocked to see in a Cartoon Network series. It deals with topics like divorce, and failure, and death in a really mature way. I was often caught off-guard by things I was sure would not be allowed on the network; honestly kind of gruesome character deaths, children being allowed to talk about the fear of dying, and anger not being depicted as an inherently villainous emotion.

I think this might be my favorite show I've watched in a long time. ‚ù§ I absolutely devoured it and now I'm sad that there's no more. I still think about it maybe once a day. But that's how you know when something is good!

In this one, Abigail Thorne discusses societal structures that incentivize the avoidance of certain types of knowledge. She theorizes why an individual might build an identity out of not knowing a thing, and how these habits can be used to create implicitly taboo types of knowledge to oppress historically marginalized groups.

It is impossible to ignore that this was released at the height of a historic tidal wave of anti-transgender hate legislation, and it couldn't have been better timed.

In my opinion this is her best work so far. :) I'm gonna keep it on hand in case I need to nudge folks on DEI issues.

Similarly, this is easily the best video hbomberguy has ever released. It's always kind of like Christmas to see something from him in my subscriptions, but yeah, this one is chefs-kiss-emoji.

Harris does a close-reading of the original study which erroneously claimed a link between autism and vaccines, really combs through all of the shoddy sources and just generally dismantles it.

Actually, erroneously isn't the right word, because he also provides an overview into the top-tier, can't-make-this-shit-up investigative journalism of Brian Deer into the con artist Andrew Wakefield. Really nothing short of *malicious* will do as a description.

Just when you think, yep, that's really bad, surely that's the end of the story, no, it gets worse. And it just keeps going.

### Shonalika

Shonalika's video on Section 28 has only become more relevant since I watched it. I'm from the 'States so I wasn't familiar with this piece of legislature; maybe you aren't either?

Section 28 essentially made it illegal to discuss being gay in a great many contexts, which had (and has, despite its repeal) a chilling effect on creators and the safety of queer folks in the UK, who despite not technically being illegal to exist, were implicitly labeled as dirty or unnatural.

Shonalika's video focuses on the impact on the work of Jacqueline Wilson, but unfortunately it has since then become more broadly and immediately applicable. Hungary just passed a very similar law in a bid to cement the support of a more conservative base in upcoming elections. It's absolutely devastating to the queer community, and countries such as Poland appear to be considering following suit.

So yeah, this is also going in my educational resources bucket.

I just discovered this artist; apparently she's well-known but I'm fashionably late to every party. I've enjoyed going backwards through time with a new video essayist.

I did not know about the distinction between sign-supported English and BSL / ASL. My university only taught the latter, and I always assumed that's all there was. The different grammatical structures are really interesting to me. I kind of want to give one a try!

She also talks about some of the really frustrating ways that folks interact with deaf people, and the micro-aggressions that often accompany that. One of the ERG's I'm a part of was putting together a Mental Health Awareness workshop at the same time I was watching this, so it was extra relevant.

I'm really excited to watch some of the other queer history episodes. I know a lot less than I thought I did!

The concept of digital blackface is something I'd really like to learn more about. Since watching this video, I've been unable to un-see those interactions in internet communities and around the workplace, in which the reactions of Black people are being used for heightened comic relief or otherwise appropriated.

Khadija is great about listing her primary sources so I'll probably start there for further research. I need to do a bit more before I feel comfortable providing feedback to peers on this topic.
