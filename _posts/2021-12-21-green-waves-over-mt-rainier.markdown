*Howdy fam! I'm not done with this article yet, I'm just testing how much load the site can handle RE: images.*

Since I last checked in, I have: moved 2,900 miles, survived Covid, organized a series of mass protests, rioted in the streets, single handedly restructured my company's SDLC, and made a pilgrimage to one of the last lesbian bars in the country. All of this has reaffirmed my belief that, yes, I am in fact superhuman.

I have never been more productive, yet so burnt out.

What little free time I've had available has felt especially precious. So, I haven't had the energy to devote to my usual critical analysis articles. I'll compromise with photo journal of my adventures, and also share some of the media I've been into!

This post has no thesis; it wonâ€™t be super deep or scholarly, but I give myself permission to just be excited about stuff sometimes.

### The Move

I'd been considering moving to Seattle someday for a while.

But in mid March this year something snapped; one anti-transgender microaggression too many, I suppose. I think I was at a grocery store, getting harassed by (yet another) clerk for having the *audacity* to be queer in public when I realized that *actually this is an emergency now, I need to move immediately*. Between the usual red-state mass bigotry, an impossibly small trans-affirming dating pool, the omni-present threat of being arrested for *walking while trans*, and the building deluge of anti-transgender legislation in the south, it just felt really urgent all of the sudden.

I was out of fucks, overcome with what I can only describe as *gay yearning*, and statistically, I knew I wasn't going to find my human in North Carolina.

So, on a dime; I packed everything I owned, shipped it to Washington, picked out a new apartment, figured out how to legally transport my cat, and single-handedly moved across the country. I accomplished this in just 14 days.

Sometimes I'm really grateful to be a project manager, and this was one of those times. I genuinely don't think I could have handled it if I didn't coordinate things like this for a living.

This move has definitely been one of the most inadvisable, stressful, impulsive things I've ever done, but in a way it was also really empowering. I pulled this off, so I genuinely believe that I can do pretty much anything at this point.

And it turns out my instinct was right; after I left, NC started explicitly rolling back human rights. I ended up just missing it. But we'll get to that.

### Seattle Adventures

I learned from my time studying abroad that you have to force yourself to get out there right away when you move. Else, the new environment makes everything take 10x more energy, and you'll just self-isolate to avoid it. So I ripped the bandaid off right away.

I went to a French restaurant / bar called Gainsbourg with Chaz and Hayden after I landed and got my new keys. I wasn't really sure what French cuisine entailed, but it was really good and I eat here pretty regularly now. [^2] For reasons that will be immediately apparent, the vibe of this place clicked with me. They have an old-fashioned film projector, and they screen old black and white films on the back wall.

I'd say I did something interesting, physically active, or touristy every day for the next two months? By now I've lost track of a lot of it, but luckily I took enough photos to jog my memory.

I took a pilgrimage to Wildrose, one of the [last remaining (15!) lesbian bars in the country](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/rise-and-fall-americas-lesbian-bars-180976801/), where I met my partner Natalie. We've been exploring the land of tossed salads and scrambled eggs together. Here we are on a double-date with Chaz and Hayden, at a local escape room called Fox in a Box. The set and atmosphere were ðŸ’¯ good shit ðŸ‘Œ, btw, would deffo recommend.

This one was a cold-war themed nuclear bunker.

Nat and I took a ferry to Bainsbridge, and toured a botanical garden called Bloedel Reserve. I saw a dog! And a boat! And a dog riding a boat! It was a boatdog. [^3]

We also visted the Museum of Pop Culture, otherwise known as the MoPOP. Apparently Seattle has some eccentric locals who collect movie props and instruments. There was a display full of authentic Riot Grrl 'zines, a section dedicated to indie game development almost hidden away, and a really interesting exhibit on the history of hip hop! I could honestly sit in the auditorium and listen to music forever.

Whoever designed the horror section clearly had the time of their lives, though. I'd honestly like them to decorate my house.

I joined a couple of community events, like the apartments "July Flamingle", an inexplicably flamingo-themed party where I met some of my neighbors. I found a nearby park that I really like, and I regularly bully kids off of the swings there. Somebody drew a little rainbow on the sidewalk, it made me smile.

Chaz, Hayden, and I made s'mores on the roof this summer, and then we ate eggs. Just like, raw eggs, crunched down on them like apples. Don't ask, it's best you don't know.

I tried to join a kink event at a swingers club on, got all dolled up, felt the most attractive I'd ever been. And the event? Turned out to be terrible. Just absolutely dreadful. Totally vanilla, nothing kink related there at all. I remember asking them, when does, you know, the kink part start? And they said *well it doesn't, we really just put that on the invite to draw a different crowd*. I tried to salvage it, ended up lounging on a couch for an hour and a half talking to one of the staff about the history of Microsoft. That was probably the highlight of the evening? LOL. [^4]

Nat and I went to an annual event here called the Fremont Solstice Fair. The main attraction is a naked bike ride which is pretty famous. Apparently public nudity is permitted in Seattle, which I did not know! It was a really welcoming atmosphere; there was so much creativity and diversity of body types. I think that's around the time it really started to hit home that Seattle is just so much *safer* for people like me. I hadn't noticed how on-guard I've had to be, until I didn't have to be any more.

(Obviously, I did not take photos of the parade, but here's a painting from a local artist I ended up taking home!)

### Activism

I was kinda famous for a minute?


### COVID-19

I managed to avoid it for over two years, but your girl finally caught the 'rona. I guess that's no surprise, given the sheer number of adventures I'd been going on.

Fortunately, it was a fairly mild case; I've been really careful about keeping up with my boosters since I'm immunocompromised. I was out of action from the fatigue for maybe two days, which I actually worked through remotely. Looking back, I wish I hadn't.

The rest of it amounted to a few weeks of sore throat. I'm grateful it wasn't worse. It did take a long time to test negative again, though. I was going a bit stir crazy by the end.

What does concern me a bit is that I never really shook the fatigue. Short bike rides still wipe me out. We don't really know much about the severity or duration of "long covid", and it does seem like our healthcare systems have given up. Frankly, I'm infuriated with the CDC. [^1]

Anyway, hopefully that's something that passes.

To be honest with you, I feel profoundly lonely over here. Not for lack of trying; as you can see I've been really putting myself out there, exploring, meeting people, and getting involved in the community. Even when it's hard or I don't feel like it.

But I'm still really struggling with this sense of isolation. I could be in a room full of people and feel like the only person there.

Not sure what the solution is. For now I'm toughing it out. I've got a good six months left in my lease. Maybe it gets better?

[^1]: Don't even get me started on how they've handled the monkeypox outbreak. We're literally repeating the HIV playbook again, and I suspect we'll do this every time the queer community needs healthcare.

[^2]: To mess with the server I called the confit "duck confetti". I'd Googled it beforehand so I knew what I was getting into, but he was a good sport about it and explained it anyway. It was also helpful to show my friends that *you absolutely cannot take me anywhere*.

[^3]: This joke is just for me.

[^4]: I've never objectively been too cool for a party before, but yeah, I left that one early.
