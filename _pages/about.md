Hey, fam!

My name is **Elizabeth Valentine Haste** (*she/her*). My pals call me Val, but I will also answer to **Your Majesty**.

I am a queer leader, a woman in tech, a feminist, witch, anarchist, and **badass**.
<br><br>
# When I grow up, I want to be a **necromancer**.
Also, I once ate so much spaghetti and threw up so hard, that I had an out-of-body experience.

<sub><sub>That is a true story.</sub></sub>

* Poetry and prose
* Unsolicited literary analysis
* Tabletop adventures
* LGBTQIA+ topics
* Pictures of my cat
* Whatever else seems fun

Whisper your message to the flighted bird of your choice, turn counter-clockwise thrice, and then throw that sucker as far as you can.

Alternatively, [here I am on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evhaste/).[^2]

[^2]: I really do prefer the bird method though if you don't mind.
