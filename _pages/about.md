Howdy, fam!

My name is **Elizabeth Valentine Haste** (*she/her*). I am a queer leader, a woman in tech, a feminist, witch, anarchist, and **badass**.

### When I grow up, I want to be a **necromancer**.

Also, I once ate so much spaghetti and threw up so hard, that I had an out-of-body experience.

<sub><sub>That is a true story.</sub></sub>
