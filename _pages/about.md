Howdy, fam!

My name is **Elizabeth Valentine Haste** (*she/her*). <!-- My pals call me Val, but I will also answer to **Your Majesty**. --> I am a queer leader, a woman in tech, a feminist, witch, anarchist, and **badass**.

Hey, by the way, **are you looking for a world-class technical project manager?**

## Good news: you found her!

#### I am a premiere **TPM and product architect**, with over 7 years of experience. I've shipped over 23 projects to date across **iOS, watchOS, Android, backend**, and **web**. And I'm looking for my next team. **Maybe it's with you?**

  <img src="/images/career/SA_badge.png" alt="A certified SAFe agilist badge">
</div>

From ideation to deployment, I'm a **full-stack force multiplier** for **cross-functional teams**. Engineers love working with me, because I effortlessly build order out of chaos and make blockers disappear like âœ¨magicâœ¨.

I have a proven history of quickly synthesizing complex regulatory requirements in the **healthcare** and **fintech** sectors (FINRA, HIPPAA, SOC2, WCAG, etc). I'm an **ERG director**, a champion for **accessibility**, and a peerless **requirements architect**.

I deftly **manage portfolio risk**, maintain **product roadmaps**, directly and personally **unblock technical teams**, provide comprehensive **user experience feedback**, and refine collaboratively to maintain crystal clear **acceptance criteria** and ticketing.

And I make a mean vegetarian chili.

## ðŸŽ¬ Critics are raving about Elizabeth Haste:

#### "Val has a super high degree of empathy and a keen mind for interfacing with stakeholders and conflicting interests. She's able to consistently provide a clean interface between these parties to optimize for a consistent velocity of work under a clear set of expectations.

<!-- # When I grow up, I want to be a **necromancer**.
Also, I once ate so much spaghetti and threw up so hard, that I had an out-of-body experience.
