My name is **Elizabeth Haste** (she/her), but we're internet friends now so you can just call me Val. I'm a queer writer and video essayist based in Seattle, Washington. Chessie is my cat and co-writer, who says: 2wmnbp0er6541.

## Here's What I'm Working On

My **nonfiction** work is primarily independent journalism at the intersection of tech, LGBTQ+, and human rights topics. I'm particularly interested stories local to the Cap Hill area; if you've got a tip for me, hit me up!

I also mix in literary criticism and academic essays, which I write for fun because I'm a weirdo with no social life. If you're into **critical theory, tabletop RPG's, antifascism,** and **niche dating sims,** then I'm basically the only place you're going to get that incredibly specific combination.

If you like **urban fantasy** or **horror**, you might enjoy my short stories. **Renegade Ghost** is a serial about Sally Blaire, a transgender superhero desperate to atone for her violent past as a vigilante. What would a truly antifascist superhero look like? I dunno and neither does she, I guess we'll find out together. It updates, uh, occasionally!

I'm also writing a novelette called **The Department of What**, which boldly asks "what if you were haunted by a ham radio". A question absolutely nobody was asking but here we are.

Finally, I produce well-researched and slightly unhinged [video essays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLhvgZ5fbVX5Clqx1S1I1Tw) on many of these same topics.

## Support the show!

Haste Makes Waste is possible thanks to the generous support of my patrons, [which you could also be](https://www.patreon.com/evhaste).

Patrons get early access to my work, and the ability to bully me in real time! You can also watch my video essays free of Youtube's shenanigans.

If all this sounds like your vibe, then you should come along!

<!-- Old one in case I ever need it again. Hi, person using the inspector! I see you. :)

My name is **Elizabeth Valentine Haste** (*she/her*). I am a queer leader, a woman in tech, a feminist, witch, anarchist, and **badass**.

### When I grow up, I want to be a **necromancer**.

Also, I once ate so much spaghetti and threw up so hard, that I had an out-of-body experience.

<sub><sub>That is a true story.</sub></sub>
