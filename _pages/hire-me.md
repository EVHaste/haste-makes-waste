Are you looking for a **world-class technical project manager?**

## Good news: you found her!

#### I am a premiere **TPM and product architect**, with over 7 years of experience. I've shipped over 23 projects to date across **iOS, watchOS, Android, backend**, and **web**. And I'm looking for my next team. **Maybe it's with you?**

</div>

From ideation to deployment, I'm a **full-stack force multiplier** for **cross-functional teams**. Engineers love working with me, because I effortlessly build order out of chaos and make blockers disappear like ‚ú®magic‚ú®.

I have a proven history of quickly synthesizing complex regulatory requirements in the **healthcare** and **fintech** sectors (FINRA, HIPPAA, SOC2, WCAG, etc). I'm an **ERG director**, a champion for **accessibility**, and a peerless **requirements architect**.

I deftly **manage portfolio risk**, maintain **product roadmaps**, directly and personally **unblock technical teams**, provide comprehensive **user experience feedback**, and refine collaboratively to maintain crystal clear **acceptance criteria** and ticketing.

And I make a mean vegetarian chili.
